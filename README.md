#GitLab Reports

GitLab Reports is a small utility web app built to help developers (using GitLab for their projects) to generate time tracking reports for their GitLab projects. App's purpose is to provide a clean, quick and to-the-point interface to track progress of the tasks.

##Features

+ After being authenticated by GitLab, developers can select desired project and then view/generate reports on the web based on select Milestone. 
+ Reports can be created based on select labels (like enhancement, bug, task etc.) and issue states (opened or closed). 
+ Developers can customize reports data by selecting what columns to show or hide.
+ GitLab Reports supports calculating Total Estimate Time and Total Time Spent of all issues including in the project report. This helps developers analyzing that how much total time they have spent on specific project milestones which helps tracking progress.
